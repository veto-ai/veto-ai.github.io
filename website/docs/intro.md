# Introduction to Veto

**Veto** is an Institutional-Grade **Identity & Safety Layer** for B2B Stablecoin Payments.

In a global economy moving toward stablecoins (USDC/USDT), businesses face a massive "Anonymous Wallet" problem. Sending $100,000 to a random hexadecimal address (e.g., `0x742d...`) is high-risk. Veto solves this by cryptographically linking corporate identities to their blockchain wallets.

## What is Veto?

Veto is not a payment rail—it sits **on top** of existing rails (like Ethereum, Stellar, and Solana) to provide a layer of trust and compliance before any value is moved.

### The Value Proposition

*   **Identity First**: Move from "Paying a Wallet" to "Paying a Verified Business."
*   **Anti-Fraud**: Prevent invoice hijacking and wallet-swapping attacks.
*   **Compliance Ready**: Automated OFAC/Sanctions screening and immutable audit logs.
*   **Consensus-Based**: The "Two-Party Handshake" ensures both sides agree on the terms before settlement.

## Who is Veto for?

1.  **Treasury Managers**: Who need institutional safety when paying global vendors.
2.  **Compliance Officers**: Who require verifiable audit trails for stablecoin transactions.
3.  **Payment Platforms**: Who want to offer "Verified Checkout" buttons to their users.
4.  **B2B Vendors**: Who want to prove their identity to increase trust with buyers.
